Welcome to HDP mutational signature extraction pipeline. For any questions, please consort the original GitHub/vignette: (https://github.com/nicolaroberts/hdp/blob/master/vignettes/mutation_signatures.Rmd), or the Stratton group. 

Analysis run selected. Please note that this is intended to be run on a HPC as it requires 20 threads. 

Setting up HDP posterior sampling chain  7  of 20. 

Chain 7: Importing user datasets. 

Input mutation matrix format detected with mutation type as rownames/in rows. Conducting data wrangling to make input matrix compatible with HDP pipeline. 

Chain 7: mutation matrix successfully imported. 

Chain 7: hierarchy matrix successfully imported. 

Chain 7: prior matrix provided. Extracting prior signatures to incorporate into HDP structure. 

Error in read.table(prior_matrix, header = T, stringsAsFactors = F, sep = "\t") :
